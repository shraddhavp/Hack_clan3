# Problem Statement
Making education interesting:
Uninteresting methods of teaching in public institutions cause young students to be easily bored which leads to a decrease in participation of children in schools(46% boys and 53% girls of the population eager to study) What is the solution, in your opinion, of uninteresting teaching methods in public schools? Hint: creatively design a digital education system.
